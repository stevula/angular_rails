# [diggit](https://diggit.herokuapp.com/)
I'm building this app to gain a better understanding of AngularJS (v1). I started by following [J. Cole Morrison's guide for configuring Angular within a Rails app](http://start.jcolemorrison.com/setting-up-an-angularjs-and-rails-4-1-project/). Then I copied over some very basic Angular code from a previous project to list posts and enable voting. 

## Goals for this project:
- refactor the pre-existing front-end logic into Angular services and directives
- external API integrations
- user auth system
- messaging
- pagination
- different media types for posts (image, video, etc)
- enhanced aesthetics
